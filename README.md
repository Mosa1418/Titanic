# 🛳️ Titanic Data Analysis

Hi there 👋
This project is a simple exploration of the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.

The main goal is to understand:

Who had a better chance of survival 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️

How survival depended on gender, class, and age

How to turn raw numbers into interactive visualizations 📊

# 📂 Project Contents

Notebook: step-by-step code with explanations

EDA: exploratory data analysis (cleaning, grouping, summarizing)

Visuals: interactive charts built with Plotly (bar, pie, histogram, scatter...)

🚀 How to Run

Download the notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Install the required libraries (if you don’t already have them):

pip install pandas plotly seaborn


Run the cells one by one and explore the charts

# ✨ Key Insights

Women in 1st class had the highest survival rate

3rd class passengers paid less but had the lowest survival chances

Age played a role, but class and gender were stronger predictors
